## 📦 About the Project

TypeScript Journal is a simple, clean journaling app built as an introduction to TypeScript with Vue. It allows users to log personal notes and assign an emotion to each entry using intuitive icon-based selection. All data is stored in **localStorage**, making it fully client-side and ideal for quick experiments or learning exercises.

This project emphasizes core TypeScript concepts in a Vue 3 context, including component typing, props validation, and safe state management. Styling is handled with **SCSS**, and the app is bundled using **Vite** for lightning-fast development.

While basic in scope, this project served as a stepping stone for exploring best practices in typed Vue development and UI responsiveness without external dependencies.
